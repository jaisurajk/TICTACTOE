# file: hangman.py is a program that plays the hangman game.
# input: Fist, the input is the file 'dictionary.txt'. Then, the user inputs are the size of the word being guessed, the number of lives, and letters the user will guess to find the right word that fits the size inputed.
# output: The outputs are the hangman game, the letters guessed, the display of the number of lives, and the correct word.
